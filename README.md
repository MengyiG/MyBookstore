The source code for this project can not be made public owning to [VT academic Honor Code](https://honorsystem.vt.edu/). However, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. :wink:

###Tech stack - Vue.js, Java, JDBC, MySQL.
The bookstore is designed and implemented by myself from scratch.

- Designed an e-commerce bookstore website with Figma and implemented all features using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js** framework.
- Created a **RESTful API** that runs on the web server over HTTP and used the DAO pattern for data access. Set up the server with the **Jersey** framework.
  Populated the database with about 30 books in 5 categories using **MySQL**.
- Used **Vuex store** to centralize components, manage bookstore states and eliminate the need to pass data using props or events.
- Validated user input from the client (**Vuelidate**) so that the bookstore only placed orders with validated user inputs.
- Hardened the website to handle invalid URL requests by setting up the **Vue Router**, redirecting users to a known bookstore page instead of a not found page.
